# The Moods App

## The Story

It is first thing in the morning. The kids are sleepy. What is there mood?
If they want too. They can go on there phone. Click on a shortcut on there home screen.
The shortcut will be a link to a web page. The kids really don't have any idea what a url is.
I don't think it is that important to tell them about it. But, the most important thing is that they have a quick way to get to _there_ data entry point.

I just had a thought. This would probably be easiest with Coda. That is a pretty good way to make web forms.
