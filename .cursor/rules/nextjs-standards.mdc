# Next.js 15 & React 19 Development Standards

## File Structure & Naming

-   Use the App Router structure with `app/` directory
-   Place components in `app/components/` or co-locate with pages
-   Use `page.tsx` for route pages, `layout.tsx` for layouts
-   Follow Next.js 15 conventions for metadata and routing

## TypeScript Standards

-   Always use TypeScript for new files
-   Use strict type checking with proper interfaces
-   Prefer `Readonly<>` for props when possible
-   Use Next.js built-in types like `Metadata` from 'next'

## React 19 Standards

-   Use functional components with hooks
-   Leverage React 19 features like automatic batching
-   Use `export default` for page components
-   Keep components simple and focused

## Styling Approach

-   Use Tailwind CSS 4 for styling
-   Import global styles in `app/layout.tsx`
-   Follow mobile-first responsive design
-   Keep UI simple and kid-friendly

## Performance

-   Use Turbopack for development (`--turbopack` flag)
-   Optimize for mobile performance
-   Keep bundle size minimal for quick loading
